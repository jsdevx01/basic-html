## Build an HTML Audio and Video Player — _Pokémon Showcase Edition_

This project demonstrates how to embed and control rich multimedia content in a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements.  
It expands on the foundational `<audio>` and `<video>` concepts by showcasing a curated set of embedded YouTube trailers centered around the **Pokémon** franchise.

## 🚀 Overview

This is a single-file project (`index.html`) that highlights how simple and powerful native HTML5 media integration can be.  
While the original project focuses on `<audio>` and `<video>`, this themed version uses **YouTube iframes** to compile and display a set of Pokémon-related videos inside a clean, structured layout.

No external libraries.  
No JavaScript.  
Just HTML.

### **📺 Themed Presentation**

The page is styled like a mini digital **Pokédex video hub**, welcoming fans of:

- Upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 speculation
- Animated features and franchise lore

All written in a fun, thematic style without altering the simplicity of the HTML structure.
