    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Chicken Breast Fillets</li>
      <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
      <li>4 tbsp piri-piri sauce</li>
      <li>½ lemon</li>
      <li>burger buns</li>
      <li>250g block lighter halloumi</li>
      <li>¼ small white cabbage</li>
      <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
      <li>4 tbsp hummus</li>
      <li>handful of rocket</li>
      <li>2 large roasted red peppers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the Morrisons British Chicken Breast Fillets between two pieces of
        baking parchment and use a rolling pin to gently bash them until they
        are approximately 1cm thick. Cut each chicken breast into two even
        pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're using a frying pan, heat two frying pans over medium-high
        heat, with one of them containing oil. Fry the chicken in the oiled pan
        for 3-4 mins on each side until they are cooked through. Season the
        chicken, reduce the heat, drizzle in the chilli sauce and half of the
        lemon juice, and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the sauce is
        reduced. Remove the chicken from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're using an air-fryer, preheat it to 180C for 4 mins. Add the
        chicken to the air-fryer and cook for 12 mins. Drizzle over the chilli
        sauce and half the lemon juice and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until
        the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced. Remove the
        chicken and keep it warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooking, toast the buns in the dry frying pan for
        30 seconds. Transfer them to a plate. If you're using an air fryer, put
        the buns in the air fryer for 1-2 mins until they are warm. Increase the
        air fryer temperature to 200C. Add the halloumi to the air fryer basket
        and cook for 10 mins, turning halfway through, until it's golden. Toss
        the cabbage with the mayo and the remaining lemon juice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the hummus (or dip of your choice) into the toasted buns, then top
        with the rocket, chilli chicken, halloumi, and peppers. Drizzle with a
        little more chilli sauce, spoon over the cabbage, season with black
        pepper, and top with the bun lids. Serve with any extra cabbage on the
        side or a green salad.
