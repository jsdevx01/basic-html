# freeCodeCamp Project - Build an HTML Audio and Video Player

This project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML5 `<audio>` and `<video>` elements to embed and control multimedia directly within a webpage.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

This is a single-file project (`index.html`) that showcases how to include both video and audio media on a webpage using the built-in HTML5 media tags.  
It provides basic playback functionality — play, pause, and loop — without any external libraries or JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

**HTML5 Media Elements:** Demonstrates essential media integration:

- `<video>` tag for embedding a video with playback controls and width attributes.
- `<audio>` tag for embedding audio with `controls` and `loop` functionality.

**Media Used:**

- **Video:** “Elephants Dream” (sample video hosted via Google Data Storage)
- **Audio:** “Running Up That Hill” (sample audio in both `.mp3` and `.ogg` formats)

**Accessibility & Responsiveness:**

- Uses `controls` attribute to ensure built-in playback accessibility.
- Includes `meta viewport` for responsive display across devices.
